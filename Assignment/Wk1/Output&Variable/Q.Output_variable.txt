Ques 1: How much space does following data types take ?

Ans 1: In typical 64 bit core architecture folowing is space taken by diffrent data types.

    int              -- 4 bytes
    bool             -- 1 bytes
    float            -- 4 bytes

Ques 2: What is the output of this program?

    void main()
    {
	    int a=4;                // variable a is assigned with int 4 
        int b=5;                // variable b with 5
        
        a++;b--;                // Now a = 5, b = 4 

    // First 'a' will be incremented to 6 and then printed but for 'b' it will be
    // printed first then decrement to 3
        cout<<++a<<” “<<b–-;    

    }

Ans 2: output: 6 4

Ques 3: How many of these can be a variable name?

Ans 3: 
    01PWskills              -- Invalid (name cannot be started with number)
    _FLOAT                  -- Valid
    int                     -- Invalid (int is keywords)
    FLOAT                   -- Ialid
    You will succeed        -- Invalid (variable name should be continuous, no spaces allowed)
