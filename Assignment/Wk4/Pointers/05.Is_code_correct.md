Q5: Is the following program snippet correct?

    ```cpp

    int main() {
      int a = 10, b = 20;
      int *ptr;
      *ptr = 5;
    }

    ```

Answer: No, it is not a correct snippet

    int a = 10, b = 20;     -- two variable a & b are declared and initialized to 
                               10 and 20 respectively
    
    int *ptr;               -- then we have declared an int pointer.

    *ptr = 5;               -- Issue here is we are directly assigning it a value by using 
                               dereferencing operator. Since int pointer is not initialized
                               with any valid memory address, so it does not points to any 
                               valid memory address. So, we cannot just derefence or access
                               it to store any value.

Approach to solve thsi issue would be initalization of int pointer (ptr) with valid memory address
like

    int *ptr = &a;
  or
    int *ptr = &b;
  
  or 
    we can create any variable of type int and use it to initialize the pointer ptr
