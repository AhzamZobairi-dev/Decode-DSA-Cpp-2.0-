Q3: Find the output of the following code snippet.

  ```cpp

    int main() {
      int a = 10, b = 20;
      int *ptr = &a;
      b = *ptr + 1;
      ptr = &b;
      cout << *ptr << " " << a << " " << b;
    }

  ```
  - [ ] 11 11 10
  - [ ] 10 10 10
  - [x] 11 10 11
  - [ ] 10 11 10

Explaination :- OUTPUT -- 11 10 11

    int a = 10, b = 20;  -- two integer a & b is declared and initialized here with 
                            10 & 20 respectively. Let us assume the respecyive address of a as 0x100 and b as 0x104.
  now,

    int *ptr = &a;       -- a pointer to an integer 'ptr' is declared & initialized
                            with the address of 'a' i.e 0x100
    
    b = *ptr + 1;        -- first the expression will be evaluated and then will be
                            intialized to b.
                            ptr have address of a i.e 0x100, when we derefernce it using
                            * operator (i.e *ptr) it gives value stored at address of 
                            a (i.e 0x100) which is 10
                            now the expression is 
                                b= 10+1; 
                            now 11 is assigned to b.
    
    ptr = &b;            -- Now we are ressigning pointer to interger 'ptr' with the 
                            address of b. So the address of b will be stored in interger 
                            pointer 'ptr' i.e 0x104.

    cout << *ptr << " " << a << " " << b;

                          -- ptr have address of b i.e 0x104, when we dereference it using
                            * operator (i.e *ptr) it gives value stored at address of 
                            a (i.e 0x104) which is 11
                          -- then 'a' which is 10
                          -- then 'b' which is 11

    OUTPUT -- 11 10 11
