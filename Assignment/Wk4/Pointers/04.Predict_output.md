Q4: Find the output of the following code snippet.

  ```cpp

    int main() {
      int a = 15, b = 20;
      int *ptr = &a;
      int *ptr2 = &b;
      *ptr = *ptr2;
    }

  ```
  - [ ] ptr now points to b
  - [ ] ptr2 now points to a
  - [x] a gets value of b
  - [ ] b gets value of a

Answer 

    int a = 15, b = 20; -- Two integer variable a,b are declared & initialized to 15 and 20                       
                           respectively          
    int *ptr = &a;      -- A pointer to integer is declared and points to variable a
    int *ptr2 = &b;     -- another pointer to integer is declared and points to variable b

    *ptr = *ptr2;       -- the *ptr points to value inside of variable a and 
                           *ptr2 points to value inside of variable b. 
                           the statemet can be rewritten to
                                    *ptr = *ptr2; => a =b;
                           Now the variable a is assigned with value in variable b, 
                           so the value in a == b == 20.
