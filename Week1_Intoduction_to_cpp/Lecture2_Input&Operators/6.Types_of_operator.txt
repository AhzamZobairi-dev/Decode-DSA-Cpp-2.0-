TYPES OF OPERATOR\

Arithmetic Operator     -- done
Relational Operator     -- in this lecture
Logical Operator        -- will lokk into basic and 
                           Will cover in IF-ELSE
Assignment Operator     -- in this lecture
Bitwise Operator        -- in bit manipulation




RELATION OPERATOR   
-- comparison of same data type
-- result is either 0 or 1

==                  is equals to 
!=                  not equals to 
>                   greater than
<                   less than
>=                  greater than equals to
<=                  less than equals to



== and = is very different
== compare two numbers
= assignment operator, assigns some value to a variable



ASSIGNMENT OPERATOR

=               assign value
+=              x+=8 => x =x+8
-=              x-=8 => x =x-8
*=              x*=8 => x =x*8
/=              x/=8 => x =x/8

x+=8 => x =x+8 both are same but =+ is efficientbecause it requires
less memory and calculations.
