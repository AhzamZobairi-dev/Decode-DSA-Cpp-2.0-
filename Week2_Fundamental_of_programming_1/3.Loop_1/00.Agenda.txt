We will discuss loop and its application in the next 4 lecture

LOOP what and why?

In general, the things we needed to do repetatively or can be some 
thinks needed to be done that are connected together by some pattern

for ex -

-- printing "Good Morning" 10 times

Typed of loop
1. for loop             -- it is discuss in Loop1
2. while loop           -- also discuss in Loop1
3. do-while loop	-- also discussed in Loop1

4. for-each loop -- used to iterate through conatiners -- discuss later
